# Django-HTMX-Websockets
 Experimenting with django websockets using htmx

App should push a notification to all users when an event occurs (in this case, a new user is created)
Notification sent via websocket, utilising django-channels package
Use HTMX to swap notification HTML into all user's views

Future application: use this for a quiz game!ls

TODO: think there's an issue with TW, need to re-do the dropdowns in navbar
